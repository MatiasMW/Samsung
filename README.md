This scrip was made with the goal to prepare a tidy data set that can be used for later analysis.
The scrip will perform the following task:
1. Download the data into a directory previously created.
2. Read the test, train and subject data.
3. Combine these data.
4. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
5. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
6. Label the data set with descriptive activity names.
7. Create a second independent tidy data set with the average of each activity and each subject.
